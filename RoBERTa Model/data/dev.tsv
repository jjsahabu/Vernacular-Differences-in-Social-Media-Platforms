63	1	a	That is a clean block by Serge
64	1	a	Kawhi must come bck in the gm . Gotta quell this Warriors spurt
65	1	a	That is a block on Draymond not a charge on Kawhi . Ref missed goaltend on Serge so it is even . 
66	1	a	"Did Steph carry the , yes or no ? "
67	1	a	That is why they did not call a foul . Knew they missed that call
