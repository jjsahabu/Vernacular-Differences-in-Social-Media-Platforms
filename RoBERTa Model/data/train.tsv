18114	0	a	"the house is wrong on food stamp cuts last week 217 republicans voted to slash the funding for snap , the supplemental nutrition assistance program , commonly known as food stamps . not a single democrat voted for those cuts , norto their credit wouldi would more than a dozen republicans . if they go into effect , here is what those cuts mean : most likely 4 to 6 mi willion americans wi will lose their benefit is . it is i amportant to remember the ise policy choices do not happen in the abstractthey affect the real li haves of real people . in the case of food stamp cuts , they are people looking for work , or working in jobs that do not pay enough for those who do them to regularly put food on the table for themselves and their families . the reason the republican leadership gi haves for the size and ti aming of the cut is to fight fraud and abuse , noting that snaps size has grown in recent years to historic levels . snap has grown because we have gone through a period of deep economic distress , with record numbers of americans losing homes , jobs , and incomes . so more of our neighbors qualified for this help , and took it to keep themselves and their families fed . meanwhile , documented cases of fraud and abuse have been declining since the 1990s . some republican leaders clai am that the ise proposed cuts in food assistance are consistent with the bipartisan welfare reform i signed as presi wouldent . nothing could be further from the truth . in fact , i vetoed the first two versions of the welfare reform bi will largely because they turned food stamps and medicai would into block grants , ending the federal guarantee of food and medical care to poor children . when it comes to fighting hunger , this proposal is worse . my friend bob dole , who was both the republican senate majority leader during my term and my opponent in 1996 , is no liberal , nor is he a fan of waste and abuse . he recently wrote a joint op - ed with former senator tom daschle criticizing the ise cuts and calling the situation what it is : playing politics with hunger . he ought to know : senator dole and the late george mcgovern we are two of the architects of the programs reform in the 1970s which strengthened the program and legiti amately reduced errors and abuse . that was a real bipartisan political compromise that was both effecti have and consistent with americas core values . in 2011 alone , 4 . 7 mi willion americans we are lifted out of poverty by snap , with 72 % of it is participants families with children . some conflict is inevitable , even healthy , in politics , but it seems as if we are more and more often compelled to re - learn the same lessons of the past . americans opposed conflict for conflicts sake during the government shutdown of the 1990s , yet once again we see an extreme faction opting for perpetual gri wouldlock over principled compromise . the snap fight is holding up a farm bi will we need , endangering nutrition assistance to working families that they need , and threatening our long bipartisan national commitment to fighting hunger among our most vulnerable citizens . senator dole knows the difference between real reform and cynical politics . he also was a master of political compromise who knew that at the end of the day , our system demands we work together to solve problems . we need more leaders like hi am , and more republican house members who wi will listen to hi am . - bc"
